## AWS Services
 I used Amazon S3 For the Storage purpose , i've created S3 bucket in the S3 storage and I mentioned input file path (to add input file path ) and 
 results file path - which means athena query results 
 I gave amazon s3 query results file path in manage settings of  athena 
 athena is basically serverless compute service
